You can genreate your own report and host it statically by running the following command

## FAQ

### It does not detect my files

You will need to configure the `extract.include` options in `windi.config.js` instead of your framework's configurations file so it can be understood by the analyzer so as other integrations support. For example:

```ts windi.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'windicss/helpers'

export default defineConfig({
  extract: {
    include: [
      'src/**/*.{vue,jsx,tsx,svelte}',
      'shared/**/*.{vue,ts}',
    ],
  },
})
```

### Can I use the report for other tools?

Yes. You can get the raw json file via the CLI

```bash
npx windicss-analysis --json report.json
```

and process it as you need.

You can also have type support for it via:

```ts
import rawReport from './report.json'
import type { AnalysisReport } from 'windicss-analysis'

const report = rawReport as AnalysisReport
```

### Programmatic Use?

Yes. Just like a normal Node package:

```ts
import { startServer } from 'windicss-analysis'

startServer({ /* ... */ })
```
