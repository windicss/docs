## Usage üöÄ

Windi CSS provides all [utilities] in [Tailwind CSS], so usage is very [similar][tailwind css].

You can use utility classes in your components and stylesheets as usual:

```html
<div class="py-8 px-8 max-w-sm mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md space-y-2 sm:py-4 sm:flex sm:items-center sm:space-y-0 sm:space-x-6">
  <img class="block mx-auto h-24 rounded-full sm:mx-0 sm:flex-shrink-0" src="/img/erin-lindford.jpg" alt="Woman's Face" />
  <div class="text-center space-y-2 sm:text-left">
    <div class="space-y-0.5">
      <p class="text-lg text-black font-semibold">Erin Lindford</p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 font-medium">Product Engineer</p>
    </div>
    <button class="px-4 py-1 text-sm text-purple-600 font-semibold rounded-full border border-purple-200 hover:text-white hover:bg-purple-600 hover:border-transparent focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-purple-600 focus:ring-offset-2">
      Message
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

[Directives] are also supported:

```css
.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}

.btn-blue {
  @apply bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white;
  padding-top: 1rem;
}
```
