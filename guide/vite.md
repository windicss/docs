# Using Windi CSS in Vite.js

<kbd>[vite-plugin-windicss]</kbd> provides simple integration for Windi CSS in Vite.

Check this [video comparison] with the PostCSS plugin for Tailwind CSS.

## Installation üíø

Add the package:

```
npm install vite-plugin-windicss --save-dev
```

Then, install the plugin in your Vite configuration:

```ts
// vite.config.js
import WindiCSS from 'vite-plugin-windicss'

export default {
  plugins: [
    WindiCSS(),
  ],
}
```

And finally, import `windi.css` in your Vite entries:

```
// main.js
import 'virtual:windi.css'
```

That's it! Build your app as you would do with Tailwind CSS, but with a faster dev experience! ‚ö°Ô∏è
